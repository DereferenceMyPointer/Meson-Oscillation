# Meson-Oscillation
 An investigation of the evolution of joint probabilities in mixed neutral mesons.

The purpose of this repository is to further probe the evolution of joint probabilities in oscillating neutral mesons, specifically the $K$ and $B$ mesons.

"LGI_mesons.ipynb" contains the code used.

The report can be found under "Correlation Function of Oscillating Neutral Mesons.pdf".
